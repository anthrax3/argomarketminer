# About

Argo is an open source trading platform, connecting directly with [OANDA][]
through the powerful [API][] to develop trading strategies.

The aim is building a platform to embed automatic trading strategies.

The name **Argo** is due to [Argo][], the ship captained by Jason in Greek
mythology, on which Jason and the Argonauts sailed from Iolcos to retrieve the
Golden Fleece.
